16S Amplicon Sequencing 
DNA was isolated from the initial pooled bacterial input and from the rhizosphere using the filter paper in contact with the roots from the same plates used in the scRNA-seq experiment. In detail, the filter paper surrounding the inoculated roots was cut and eluted in 5 mL water and DNA was extracted using the MP Fast DNA Spin kit for soil. In total, DNA from seven replicates (each replicate containing filter paper from 10 plant roots) was isolated and used to create a library for amplicon sequencing. The library preparation started with the amplification of the V5-V7 region of the 16S rRNA gene. This amplification was achieved using barcoded PCR primers, specifically primers 799F and 1193R, through 25 cycles. Subsequently, a second round of PCR was conducted to incorporate the essential flanking regions, which comprised Adapter, Index, and Read modules. By using the NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) from Novogene, we conducted paired-end sequencing (2x250) with the objective of reaching 40M reads. Raw sequence data, post demultiplexing, were subjected to processing using QIIME2 (version 2019.04, https://qiime2.org/). The initial raw reads were denoised using the DADA2 pipeline, effectively generating amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Subsequent to denoising, sequences underwent a filtration process, and any chimera present were removed utilizing default settings. To enhance the interpretability of the data, a custom database comprising the 16S sequences of the Synthetic Community members was integrated. This integration facilitated the assignment of isolate names (LjRoot) through the application of the VSEARCH tool. Finally, the calculation of relative abundances and alpha/beta-diversity plots were created on R (Version 4.1.0). 
The sequencing encompassed a total of eight samples, including one control sample (Input SynCom, just before inoculation) and seven biological replicates. However, it is notable that one of the biological replicates yielded a significantly low number of reads, rendering it unsuitable for further analysis after the filtering process. Consequently, we proceeded with the analysis using the remaining six biological replicates, ensuring the reliability of our microbiome profiling results.
